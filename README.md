# ü§ñ RAG Chatbot: Domain-Specific Q&A Bot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot designed to answer domain-specific questions accurately by combining **retrieval-based systems** with **large language models (LLMs)**. This project preprocesses domain-related documents, retrieves relevant context dynamically, and generates precise answers using **Llama 3** hosted locally via **Ollama**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Domain-Specific Question Answering**:
  - Accurately answers user queries based on a predefined set of documents.
  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**:
  - Combines document retrieval from **ChromaDB** with LLM-powered generation for contextually accurate responses.

- **Local LLM Deployment**:
  - Uses **Ollama** to host the **Llama 3 model** locally, ensuring privacy and security.

- **Context-Aware Responses**:
  - Designed with a strict **prompt template** to enforce reliable and domain-specific answers, preventing out-of-scope responses.

- **API Integration**:
  - Built with **FastAPI**, exposing a RESTful endpoint for seamless interaction between the frontend and the backend.
